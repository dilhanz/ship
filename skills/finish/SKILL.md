Finish the active feature after verification passes.

## Find Active Feature

Feature state is injected by hooks at session start and after compaction — check conversation context for "SHIP ACTIVE FEATURES" or "SHIP FEATURE STATE" blocks first.

1. If `$ARGUMENTS` is provided, use it as the feature name
2. Otherwise, use injected feature state to identify the feature with status `done`
3. If no injected state is available, fall back to scanning `.planning/features/*/CONTEXT.md`
4. If no candidates, report that no finished features were found

## Prerequisites

Run the project's test suite to confirm everything passes:

```bash
# Auto-detect test command from package.json, Cargo.toml, etc.
# If unclear, ask the user for the test command
```

If tests fail, stop and report failures. Do not proceed.

## Present Options

```
Feature '{name}' is verified and complete.

1. Create a Pull Request (push branch + gh pr create)
2. Merge to {base-branch} locally
3. Keep as-is (I'll handle it later)

Which option?
```

Use AskUserQuestion to get the user's choice.

## Execute Choice

### Option 1: Create PR

First, check that `gh` is available: `gh auth status`. If it fails, tell the user to install/authenticate `gh` and abort.

```bash
# Detect base branch
git rev-parse --verify main &>/dev/null && echo main || echo master

# Determine PR title type from branch commits
# Look at commit prefixes (feat, fix, refactor, etc.) — use the most common one
# If mixed or unclear, default to "feat"

# Get feature summary from CONTEXT.md for PR body
# Push and create PR
git push -u origin HEAD
gh pr create --title "{type}: {feature-name}" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
{2-3 bullets from CONTEXT.md acceptance criteria}

## Test plan
{key verify commands from PLAN.md}

Built with [Ship](https://github.com/dilhanz/ship)
EOF
)"
```

Report the PR URL to the user.

### Option 2: Merge Locally

```bash
# Detect base branch
BASE=$(git rev-parse --verify main &>/dev/null && echo main || echo master)

git checkout $BASE
git merge {feature-branch}
```

Run tests again on the merged result. If tests pass, report success.

### Option 3: Keep As-Is

Report: "Feature '{name}' kept on current branch. Run `/ship:finish` again when ready."

## Report

```
## FEATURE FINISHED

Feature: {name}
Action: {PR created / Merged to main / Kept as-is}
{If PR:} PR: {url}
{If merged:} Branch merged and tests passing
```
